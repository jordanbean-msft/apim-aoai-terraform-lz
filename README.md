## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- Azure subscription & resource group
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform#windows)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows)
- `Owner` level permissions on the resource group you wish to apply the Terraform to (since it uses RBAC to set up access to Cosmos, OpenAI, Key Vault, etc)
- [REST Client for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

### Azure

A virtual network of at least a `/25` and 3 subnets (each at least `/27` ) to associate with API Management & the private endpoints.

### Entra ID

2 service principals, one to represent OpenAI at the API Management level and one to represent your application.

#### OpenAI Service Principal

- Set the `redirect-uri` in the `Single Page Application` to `https://<name-of-api-management-service>.developer.azure-api.net/signin` (you can do this after setting up API Management). You should also check the box for `Implicit grant and hybrid flows->ID tokens`.
- Expose a scope called `user_impersonation` and specify an `Application ID URI`. This permission should require admin consent.

#### Application Service Principal

- Needs to have the `Application ID URI/user-impersonation` API permission to the OpenAI Service Principal configured above. You will need to get admin consent for this scope before use.
- Redirect_Uri
    - For the `sample-openai.http` file (or a regular web application that wants to authenticate an interactive signed-in user), add a `Web->redirect_uri`.
    - For the `sample-openai.ipynb` file, add a `Mobile and desktop applications->redirect_uri`.

## Deployment

1. Update the `infra/provider.conf.json` file with where you intend to store the Terraform state file.
1. Update the `infra/main.tfvars.json` file with specifics of your environment.

1. Run the following command to deploy the solution

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

## Test

- Use the included `sample-openai.http` file
- Use the Python notebook `sample-openai.ipynb` file
